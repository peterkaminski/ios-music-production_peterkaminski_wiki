# Introductions

The idea of this page is that it will list "introductions to topics" - something that gives you an overview of a small, particular part of iOS music production.

The first one is Doug from The Sound Test Room, walking through the various drum machines in Korg Gadget: [KORG Gadget - Cool Stuff You Can Do With The Drum Machines - iPad Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQ3iJNLkdQ0) (YouTube)..
