## Loopers and Looping Tutorials

These aren't specifically iOS-based loopers, but looping and sequencing are key skills for many people making music with iOS apps. Watch, learn, be inspired.

### Marc Rebillet

Marc has a dynamic (shall we say) YouTube persona, but he's also a great looper, using a BOSS RC-505. His HOW TO FUNK IN TWO MINUTES is a quick and easy-to-watch demonstration of how to quickly lay down the tracks for song.
