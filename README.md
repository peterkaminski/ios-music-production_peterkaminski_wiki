# iOS Music Production

by Peter Kaminski

This is a work-in-progress information resource about music production with iOS devices and apps. It was created in June 2023, and was last updated in June 2023.

This website is at the "sprout"/"seedling" stage right now, if you were to classify it in the [[Stages in a Tree's Lifecycle]]. Check the sidebar at the left for a list of important pages to start reading with.

A production note: [[ChatGPT]] and other AI language tools have been used to create parts of this website. There will be a short notice at the top of any page where an AI language tool had significant contribution to the content of that page. Prompts and inclusion of output will be thoughtful and considered by me, a human, and I take responsibility for the overall content of this website.

Please feel free to contact me, Peter Kaminski, the maintainer of this site: [kaminski@istori.com](mailto:kaminski@istori.com). Thanks for dropping by!
