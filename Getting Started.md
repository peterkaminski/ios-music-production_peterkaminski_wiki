# Getting Started

I think there are _lots_ of ways to get started with iOS music production, and someday, maybe this page will list more of the ways.

But for now, say you're a little familiar with music, and you want to make some short beats / songs. You don't really play an instrument.

You might think you want a DAW (see [[Types of Apps]]), and that's not a bad place to start. The easier DAWs to start with might be Korg Gadget 2 or Beatmaker 3. They are both wonderful; I think for a beginner getting used to DAWs, I'd pick Gadget.

(My personal go-to pro DAW, after getting used to Gadget, is Cubasis 3, which works with my desktop DAW, Cubase. Other folks might also use GarageBand or Logic Pro, which is now available for iOS, or any of a number of good iOS apps.)

For more about DAWs, Jakob Haq has this great overview: [My Top iOS DAW and Music Production Apps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1inq9I8HgU) (YouTube)

_Don't_ start with [[AUM, Audiobus, apeMatrix]], although when you get there, AUM or whatever will be super fun.

You could actually skip a DAW altogether and start with one of the sequencers / sample players / drum machines.  **This might get you making beats and short songs a lot faster.**

There are sort of two kinds, the ones that have a grid and you put notes on the grid, in a few different tracks; or, there are the kind that algorithmically generate sequences, or have some really cool interface that you can only get on a computer or mobile device. Pick your poison. ðŸ™‚

If you have a simple MIDI keyboard (Korg nanoKey, Akai MPK Mini mkII, M-Audio Keystation) connected to your iOS device via USB or Bluetooth, you might like a "step sequencer", which allows you to enter notes on your MIDI keyboard one at a time, moving to the next step in the grid every time you press a key. This records the notes one by one, but not the timing or the performance. (A DAW will generally record a MIDI performance in real time onto a grid -- and you'll do that someday -- but it can be completely overwhelming to start there.)

Some step sequencer advice from the web:

- [Are there any iOS step sequencers](https://forum.audiob.us/discussion/44046/are-there-any-ios-step-sequencers)

Also, pick a few synthesizers / sample players, that probably won't have a performance grid, but that are fun to play with to make musical sounds. Some of my faves (obviously, start with 1-3, not all, lol):

- lots of synths from Gadget
- Addictive Pro (and any thing from VirSyn)
- Colossus Piano
- Infinite
- Poison-202
- Pure Piano
- iLectric Piano
- Ravenscroft 275 Piano
- iGrand Piano
- StrandOrgan, Chapel Organ - any of the Markus Sigg organs, actually

A special treat is GeoShred, which is a super cool instrument interface, but which also has the great physically modeled GeoSWAM instruments.  (Which reminds me, we'll have to get into MPE at some point, but not for starters.)

YouTube is a _great_ place to learn more. Check out some of the [[YouTubers]].

P.S. This is not about music, but: if you're buying an iPad, get one that will work well with an Apple Pencil 2, then get Procreate and watch Procreate how-to and tutorial videos on YouTube. Along with iOS music production, it is another amazingly powerful, wonderful, relatively inexpensive creative experience that I wish everybody could enjoy.
