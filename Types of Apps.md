There are a variety of types of software tools and applications used in music production, each serving a unique purpose. They all work together to form a music production ecosystem.

Also see a special page on [[AUM, Audiobus, apeMatrix]], which are router/mixer/hubs used to multiplex audio and music apps on iOS.

Here are a few:

**Digital Audio Workstations (DAWs):** These are comprehensive software applications used for recording, editing, and producing audio files. DAWs serve as the central hub for most music production environments, providing tools to compose, record, edit, and mix music. Examples on iOS include Cubasis 3, Gadget 2, BeatMaker 3, Auria Pro, Logic Pro, and GarageBand.

**Sequencers:** Sequencers are software applications used to record, edit, and play back music by manipulating values representing musical notes and performance parameters. Sequencers can manage both MIDI data and digital audio, allowing you to arrange your music in a linear or pattern-based fashion. An example of an iOS sequencer is StepPolyArp Unit.

**Synthesizers:** These are used to generate audio. They come in many different forms and can produce a wide range of sounds, from imitations of real-world instruments to entirely unique electronic tones. Examples on iOS include Moog Model D, Animoog, and Sunrizer.

**Samplers:** A sampler is a device or software that can record sounds (or samples) and then play them back. Samplers allow you to manipulate these samples in various ways â€“ such as changing their pitch or duration. An example of an iOS sampler is Koala Sampler.

**Drum Machines:** These are specialized sequencers that are specifically designed for creating drum and percussion sounds. They often come with built-in sounds and rhythmic patterns. An example of an iOS drum machine is DM1.

**Effects Processors:** These are used to process and modify sounds. There are many types of effects, including reverb, delay, distortion, compression, and equalization, each serving a unique purpose. An example of an iOS effects processor is the FabFilter Pro series.

**Loopers:** These are devices or applications that allow you to record a segment of music and then play it back in a loop. This can be useful for building up layers of sound over time. An example of an iOS looper is Loopy HD.

**DJ Apps:** These are designed to simulate the experience of DJing using digital music files. They often include features for beatmatching, cueing, and mixing between tracks, as well as effects for manipulating the sound. An example of an iOS DJ app is Djay.

**Audio Editors:** These are tools for editing recorded audio. This could involve cutting, copying, and pasting audio, removing noise, applying effects, or other modifications. An example of an iOS audio editor is Hokusai Audio Editor.

**MIDI Controllers:** These are software interfaces that generate and send MIDI data to other music software or hardware. They often resemble traditional music interfaces like keyboards or drum pads, but they can also take on more unique forms. An example of an iOS MIDI controller is TouchOSC.

Each of these categories has its unique place in the music production process, and many apps can fit into multiple categories.

DAWs and sequencers provide the foundation for arranging and editing all the various elements of a piece of music. This includes integrating the audio generated from synthesizers, samplers, drum machines, and other musical elements. Some DAWs may also include their own synthesizers, samplers, and effects processors.
